# Summer Internship at Rincon Research Corporation
I was privileged to go to Tucson, AZ to work as an intern in the summer of 2022. This was between
finishing my senior year of my undergraduate program at Utah State and starting my last year of my
graduate program (I was in a concurrent program, so got a bit of a fast track). I was selected along
with five others to participate. Three of us were in electrical engineering with a signal processing
background, and two were majoring in computer science. The last intern was actually still in high
school and was functioning as the IT guy for the rest of the interns. He did a fantastic job for not
having any prior experience with Linux or many IT-related skills.

The project us interns had the opportunity to work on was a machine-learning-based indoor geolocation
system. In other words, indoor GPS. For the purposes of our internship, we assumed that the target
to be tracked would have a radio transmitter (which I agree, is part of what GPS is, but the 
research direction was to be able to do it without a transmitter on the target. Thus, I bring it up).

The key things I learned as part of this internship include:
- Network communication protocols
- GNU Radio capabilities (to add to what I began to learn at the [IDL](./idl.md))
- Needs for team goal setting and planning
- Spread-spectrum communication
- 

Below I will go over a few of the things that I worked on in this system.
