### Daren Swasey's Coding Portfolio

Howdy! I am Daren Swasey, currently a graduate student at Utah State University. I am working on a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering with an emphasis in Controls and Signal Processing. I hold a job as an undergraduate researcher in signal processing, and I have done it since March 2021

I have been coding since my middle-school years, dabbling in C# briefly before moving on to C++ in high-school. Since then, I have grown to learn Python, Java, C, Matlab, Assembly, and Verilog. I have a few years of experience with Linux and Git VCS as well, rounding off some good software development skills that I have learned over the years in my EE degree and from the classes I took in my Computer Science Minor. Way before then, my experiences as a member of a FIRST Robotics programming team and what I learned from playing with LEGO Mindstorms set really showed me the potential of what can be done with code and hardware combined. I have been coding and learning how to code better ever since.

Below, I would like to showcase a few things I have done over the years.

## Proudest Achievement: My Own "2D Printer"
<!-- insert image of 2D printer results -->
Plotter is definitely the common name for this, but I wasn't aware of it until I did some more research. For the Mechantronics class at USU, the main objective of the class was to design a build a project of your own choosing. My team included myself and two mechanical engineers. We decided we wanted to build a "2D Printer", or in other words as described by one of my teammates, a "drawing gantry" (I would never have come up with that term. It isn't that I don't like it, but it is clearly a mechanical engineer's mind at work, haha).

I won't go through all the details, but to summarize:
- Utilized a BeagleBone Black Microcontroller
- Made edge detection, path tracing, and path following code from scratch. No 3rd-party libraries for me! (except   the ones that ran the Beagle)
- It worked. It also happened to make some really cool images. Below is one that I came up with and plotted using some assets I found online.

## Other Notable Projects
There's a lot of stuff I have done over the years with code, and I would like to make mention of a few of them here.

### STM32L476VGTx Audio Recorder and Playback System
This was a very challenging project to put together. It was created as a final project for a Microcontrollers class at USU. This little system used an on-board microphone in combination with a small piezo-electric speaker to record and play back audio. It was definitely low quality, but the point it that it worked. It took long hours of pouring over the massive datasheet for the STM32L476 finding all the correct bits to set, figuring out how to make an intuitive menu with a limited 7-segment LCD screen. It had features like playing in reverse, changing the speed and volume of playback, and of course, recording. It was a pretty fun little project!

### GNU Radio Multi-Antenna Real-Time Intrusion Detection System
In March of 2021, I began work with Dr. Todd K. Moon, a professor at USU who teaches primarily signal processing classes. At the time, I was tasked with the goal of what amounted to an indoor "burglar alarm" that ran off of radio signals and software-defined radios (SDRs). After a grueling process of study, research, testing, failing, testing, progress, and more testing, I was able to come up with several algorithms for intrusion detection. These algorithms ran in the GNU Radio environment in sort of a pseudo-real-time fashion, and the results were actually quite surprising in a positive way. Check out my video from GRCon [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcKWgyM55To&t=1s).

### List of Smaller Class Projects or Personal Projects
- Sudoku puzzle generator and solver (C++)
- Binary search trees, balancing binary trees (C++, Java)
- Completely software-based QPSK transmitter and receiver. Included my own code for PLL, TED, cubic interpolation using a Farrow filter, and complex signal symbol decision. (Python)
- Software-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) algorithms for generating radar-based images (Matlab)
- UART communication on FPGA (Verilog)
- Basic CPU scheduling algorithms, page replacement, multi-threaded task completion (Java)
